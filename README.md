# Starting point for projects with React, Redux, and Bootstrap 4

### Based on react-slingshot

There is a redux store with a basic setup and an example action (testAction) as guidance.

**Containers** are meant for 'connected/smart' Components

**Components** are meant for 'dumb' Components

Sass is setup with Bootstrap variables in **_variables.scss** and which then get passed into **style.scss**
